# Project-IRIS-Game

A Game-Dev project with the goal of creating a game with the title of IRIS.

Made with C# & Unity3d

One of our first concepts was a first-person platforming / parkour-esque game that would be fast paced, 
and would be able to be speed-ran.

Some of these elements remain in the game, but ultimately (due to time constraints, and other reasons) the game's final
concept changed to a first-person exploration game, with a gameplay element where you have a limited amount of seeing
capabilities. 

The player can turn the light on by pressing E or F (I only wanted F but whatever), but the lights only remain on for a few seconds.
Requiring the player to check their surroundings quickly, as they also have a limited amount of uses for the light.

The goal is to find a 'beacon' of sorts, after finding and touching it, you win the game.

You cannot die or lose in the game, when you fall down you just get reset to the starting position.

But you can however lose the ability to see the world with light, after which it can be pretty hard, but not impossible, to find the beacon.
